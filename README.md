# Draw-It-or-Lose-It-Framework

This is a web-based version of the Draw It or Lose It game, which is currently available on Android. The project was developed as a solution for The Gaming Room client by Creative Technology Solutions (CTS) technology consultant.

Project Overview

The Draw It or Lose It game is based on the popular game show, Win, Lose or Draw, in which teams compete to guess what is being drawn. The web-based game will use stock drawings as clues, and a game will consist of four rounds of play, each lasting one minute. If the team cannot guess the puzzle before time expires, the remaining teams have an opportunity to offer one guess each to solve the puzzle with a 15-second time limit.

Software Requirements

The following software requirements have been met for the game application:

The game can have one or more teams involved.
Each team will have multiple players assigned to it.
Game and team names must be unique to avoid conflicts.
Only one instance of the game can exist in memory at any given time.
